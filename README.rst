    $ cd obliquity
    $ python setup.py install [--user]

Basic usage
-----------

.. code-block:: python

    from obliquity.distributions import Cosi_Distribution
    cosi_dist = Cosi_Distribution((1.3,0.1),(15,0.3),(3.5,0.5)) #Radius, Prot, VsinI
    cosi_dist.summary_plot()

**Command-line scripts**

In addition to the ``obliquity`` module, this package also installs a few command-line scripts.  

``write_cosi_dist``: This calculates a ``Cosi_Distribution`` given input parameters, and writes the distribution to 
file (`.h5` format that can be easily re-loaded back).
